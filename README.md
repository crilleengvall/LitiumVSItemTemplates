# LitiumVSItemTemplates
Adds templates to Visual Studio for different Litium specific classes. This speeds up the creation of for example a Service, ServiceDecorator, ValidationRule, ViewController and BlockController.

In the case of creating a Service, as in the gif above, the generated class will have the correct attribute already added.

Tested in VS2019, Litium 7 and 8.
